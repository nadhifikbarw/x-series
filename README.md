# X-Series

The motivations that started my X-series ( explore, experiment, explain, examples (?) ) came from place of vulnerabilities and practicality.

* A practice to be more comfortable learning in public, writing and putting stuff out there.
* A playground to experiment with various forms of writing technical topics.
* A mechanism to write loose references, to share with others or as my own future-self, without the full commitment of longform writings.
* An outlet to connect the dots between few numbers of subject, in order to make it less obscure and more explicit. Some docs/config/tech can feel very obscure without the proper context/assumed understanding. It's for various reasons, mainly due to brevity concerns.
* An outlet for me to practice Feynman technique, I learn and retain information way better using it.

- "I'm not doing enough"
- "I'm not doing it fast enough"
- "It's not difficult enough problems that I'm solving"

These are common thoughts that sometimes occur in me when starting something new. This often poisons the well of curiosity that push me to love tech to begin with.

Instead of seeing new set of problems with eyes of curiosities, it turns them into mountains of "proving ground", "i should be able to do this, why am not doing it already".

To me, it becomes source of anxieties and reduce my joy of learning. Start from "I wonder how ..." rather than "I should have ..."
