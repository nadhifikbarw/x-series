# X-Series

Motivations that started my X-series ( explore, experiment, explain, examples (?) ) came from place of vulnerabilities and practicality.

* A playground to experiment with various forms of writing to find styles that I like to communicate technical topics effectively.
* A practice to be more comfortable learning in public, writing and putting stuff out there. ["Work with the garage door up"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ).
* A mechanism to write loose references, to easily share topic I worked on with others or for my own future-self. ["Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9).
* An outlet to build publicly available interconnected knowledge, no matter how simple or complex certain topic is, the abilities to utilize them in interconnected fashion are what makes it valuable. Accretion of knowledge typically is what define expertise, either through pealing layer of abstractions further or exposing yourself to various new scenario.
* Human body tend to follow this pretty hard rule "Use it or lose it", I'm not going to pretend that I'm never going to succumb to shortcuts that might be presently available. After all there are billion dollars industries out there competing for everyone attention span, constantly pushing you to defer thinking, with very unfortunate externalities [that has been making Internet less and less welcoming space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-opBifFfsMY).
* Convenient way to practice Feynman technique, I learn and retain information way better using it.

- "I'm not doing enough"
- "I'm not doing it fast enough"
- "It's not difficult enough problems that I'm solving"

These are common thoughts that sometimes occur in me when starting something new. This often poisons the well of curiosity that push me to love tech to begin with.

Instead of seeing new set of problems with eyes of curiosities, it turns them into mountains of "proving ground", "i should be able to do this, why am not doing it already".

To me, it becomes source of anxieties and reduce my joy of learning. Start from "I wonder how ..." rather than "I should have ..."
